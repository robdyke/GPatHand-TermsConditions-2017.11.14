If you are a medical professional, then we will not be liable to the extent that any loss or damage is attributable to your failure to comply with the usage terms at clause 2.

We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

When we are liable for damage to your property. If defective digital content that we have supplied damages a device or digital content belonging to you, we will either repair the damage or pay you compensation. However, we will not be liable for damage that you could have avoided by following our advice to apply an update offered to you free of charge or for damage that was caused by you failing to correctly follow installation instructions or to have in place the minimum system requirements advised by us.

Where you are a consumer (and not a medical professional) we are not liable for business losses. If you are a consumer, the App is for domestic and private use. If you use the App for any commercial, business or resale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.

Where you are not a consumer we are not liable for indirect or consequential losses. We will have no liability to you for any:

loss of income or revenue;
loss of profit;
loss of business and/or contracts;
business interruption;
loss of business opportunity;
loss of anticipated savings;
loss of data;
loss of goodwill; or
wasted administrative or management time.
Limitations to the App and the Service. The information that we supply to you by way of the App and the Services is provided for general information only. We do not offer advice on which you should rely. You must obtain professional or specialist advice before taking, or refraining from, any action on the basis of information obtained from the App or the Service.  Although we make reasonable efforts to update the information provided by the App and the Service, we make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that such information is accurate, complete or up to date.

Protecting personal data used with the App. We recommend that you delete any messages sent or received by way of the App as soon as you no longer need them as this will help to protect the security of the data.

Check that the App and the Services are suitable for you. The App and the Service have not been developed to meet your individual requirements. Please check that the facilities and functions of the App and the Services meet your requirements.

We do not promise that the Service will be uninterrupted or constantly available. Where you are a medical professional:

our Service is not an alternative to your normal professional practices and procedures, particularly in relation to emergencies.
You are not entitled to rely upon our Service being constantly available and must remain up-to-date and properly informed as to the procedures maintained by the institution(s) for which you work.
21. We may end your rights to use the App and the Service if you break these terms

We may end your rights to use the App and the Service at any time by contacting you if you have broken these terms in a serious way. If what you have done can be put right we will give you a reasonable opportunity to do so.

If we end your rights to use the App and the Service:

You must stop all activities authorised by these terms, including your use of the App and the Service.
You must delete or remove the App from all devices in your possession and immediately destroy all copies of the App which you have and confirm to us that you have done this.
We may remotely access your devices and remove the App from them and cease providing you with access to the Service.
22. We may transfer this agreement to someone else

We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract.

23. You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else

You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree in writing.

24. No rights for third parties

This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement.

25. If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force

Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.

26. Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later

Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.

27. Law and Jurisdiction

These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the English courts. If you are a consumer (and not a medical practitioner) and live in a country outside England you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the App/Service in either the English courts or the courts of your home country.
