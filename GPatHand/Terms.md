Please read these terms carefully so that you understand them. These terms cover all the services we provide to you through our healthcare app (App) and our website https://www.gpathand.nhs.uk (Website). These terms include details on our complaints procedure, what we need from you to provide our services, and how we may use your personal information (as further detailed in our Privacy Policy).

When you use the GP at hand Service, our healthcare practitioners serve you from the UK. We are regulated by the UK's Care Quality Commission. Because we're providing UK-regulated healthcare services, we need to explain our services to you in detail in these terms and conditions.

You will be asked to accept these terms as part of App registration and when you use our services.

The way we work is simple: we’re here to serve you and will always do the right thing to ensure you have the best possible experience. We hold ourselves to the highest legal and ethical standards and we will never jeopardise your trust in us by failing to live up to these ideals. We value hearing from you so if you have any questions or ideas, don’t hesitate to get in touch by calling 0330 808 2217, or emailing gpathand@nhs.net

There are some important limitations on our obligations set out in these terms. The most important of these are:

We provide remote health advice and information services. Some conditions are not suitable for remote advice and we recommend that you check our FAQs prior to use of the services which may help you in assessing their suitability in relation to your symptoms (see sections C and L)
We need certain information from you in order to provide services (see section D)
We can't take responsibility for laws outside the UK governing access to our services. Some of our services are specifically designed for use in the UK, and if you use them elsewhere you should check in your country or region that it is appropriate and lawful for you to do so (see sections F, I and J)
The App is not suitable for managing medical emergencies (see section C2)
The App is not suitable for unrestricted use by persons under 16 (see section G)
The GP at hand Partnership shall not be responsible for the artificial intelligence symptom checker which is a separate service provided by babylon via the App.
We may amend these Terms from time to time as set out in section N. Please check to ensure you understand the terms that will apply at the time you enter into any transaction with the Company. These Terms were most recently updated on 16 November 2017.

These terms include descriptions of each section, in bold text. These descriptions are to help you understand the terms but they are not part of the terms.
A) ABOUT US

About us and our services

We provide healthcare services using the App and our Website. Our services provide healthcare assessments, consultations, information and access to diagnostic tests and kits, and healthcare products.

Our services are provided using qualified medical professionals (Practitioners) based in the UK.
You can contact us by telephone at 0330 808 2217, or by email at gpathand@nhs.net. If you need to write to us or send us a notice under these terms you can do so by email or writing to the above address.
B) OUR PARTNERS
Your relationship with our partners

You may access our services because of your relationship with one of our partners (Partners). If you have a relationship with one of our Partners, some additional terms may apply to your use of our services, which will be provided to you by the Partner from time to time or are as listed below at Y for specified Partners.
C) OUR SERVICES
What our services cover, and what you need to check yourself when you use our services





We provide our services remotely, using our App and Website and remote communication methods such as email. Our services include:
remote video and voice consultations with our healthcare professionals;
the ability to enter questions and symptoms to determine the best course of action for your healthcare needs;
the ability to ask questions of our healthcare professionals;
our Monitoring service, which monitors your health (see section K);
access to healthcare tests, medicines and kits (see sections H, I and J); and
access to your healthcare records.
Some medical conditions are not suitable for remote consultations, and you should always seek advice from a medical practitioner in person if you are unsure about whether you have been able to explain or communicate your medical needs through our services, or if you have any concerns about the advice you receive from us or if it is different from other advice you have received. All services are currently only provided in English.
You should not use our digital services in an emergency, or if you have a condition that you know will require a physical examination.
Except for our remote consultation services, our information services such as our Check a symptom and Ask a question services provide healthcare information and not medical advice. They tell you about health conditions, their possible causes and available treatments. They do not diagnose your own health condition or make recommendations for treatment for you. If you use our information services, we recommend you also seek the advice of a healthcare professional on your treatment, but whether you do so or not is up to you. You shouldn't take or stop taking any action (such as taking medicines) based on information from our services.
We provide our services using reasonable skill and care from appropriately qualified, and experienced, staff and Practitioners. If you think that our services have not met this standard, please contact us as soon as possible. We will fix or re-perform, without charge, any services we agree do not meet this standard.
Practitioners are GPs, registered nurses or accredited specialists registered with the General Medical Council or other appropriate professional register, who have committed to provide services in accordance with clinical best practice and applicable professional standards.
Practitioners will not prescribe medicines unless it is, in their judgement, in their patient's best interests (and may not be able to prescribe medicines on the basis of a remote consultation).
We protect your personal healthcare information in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable standards on the handling of personal data in the UK.


D) WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES
We can't provide our services without certain information and other things from you



We can only provide the services in accordance with these terms if you provide us with the information we need in order to help you. You must be careful that:
any information you give to us or a Practitioner, or enter into the App is accurate and in English;
if you have any concerns about the services we provide you or any information in the App or the Website, you seek further medical advice from or another medical professional;
you follow any instructions you are given by Practitioners;
you follow any instructions regarding the use of any medicines or healthcare products we recommend or prescribe (including in respect of use-by dates);
you report any adverse or unexpected effects of treatments we recommend to us;
you keep any medicines we give you securely and do not allow others (especially children) to use them;
you tell us if any of our information about you is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete;
you use our services only for yourself, unless you are helping a child further to term G.
We tailor our services to suit you and rely on an accurate record of your use of services in order to do this. Please do not therefore register more than once for our services.
E) TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THE APP
The App includes software provided by people other than the Company, and uses certain data that you provide to it in order to work



The App operates only on iPhone version 4S or higher running iOS 9.3 or higher, or Android-enabled phones running Android v4.2 or higher. It requires a consistent 4G or faster data connection and does not operate reliably on 3G, GPRS or EDGE connections.
We recommend that if you are using a wireless network to access the App, you avoid use of public wi-fi facilities in favour of a personal wi-fi connection, and that the wireless network is secured with WPA-2 security. We recommend that the device from which you access the App is password protected, set to lock after a short period of inactivity, and protected with suitable anti-virus and anti-malware software.
From time to time, updates to the App may be made available to you. We recommend that you use the latest version of the App at all times, to take advantage of the latest enhancements. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use the Services until you have downloaded or streamed the latest version of the App and accepted any new terms.
F) REGULATION OF OUR SERVICES
Accessing our services outside the UK



Our services are available to any adult (and to children in accordance with section G).
Our services are provided from facilities in the UK, and regulated by the Care Quality Commission in the UK (whose website is www.cqc.org.uk).
If you are accessing our services from outside the UK, you should check whether it is lawful to access our services in the territory where you are. We provide our services in compliance with UK and Irish law and regulation, and cannot take responsibility for any differences between those rules and any different rules applying to healthcare services anywhere else.
G) CHILDREN AND OUR SERVICES
Adults can use our services on behalf of children, but children shouldn't use our services themselves

H) PRODUCT SALES
We provide services which enable your purchase of products from third party sellers working with us

The App enables your purchase of healthcare and other products (Products) sold by our third party product partners (Suppliers).
If you use the App to order a Product, our responsibility is to place that order on your behalf with its Supplier. Your contract for supply of a Product is with the Supplier, not with us and the Supplier is responsible for Product sourcing, quality and delivery.
As part of the Product order process, a Supplier will contact you with the terms and conditions applying to your Product order including your right to cancel.
Please contact us if you have any issues with your Product order. We will, acting on your behalf, raise these with the Supplier.
Product images on the App are illustrations and we do not enable the ordering of Products accurately reflecting their colours as shown on the App.
Where applicable, we will collect payment for your Product order when it is made, but will refund your payment if the Product ordered is not in stock or cannot be supplied. If a Supplier makes a refund of amounts paid by you to us, we will pass that refund to you.
I) MEDICINES
How medicines are prescribed to you


In the United Kingdom, services are provided by qualified doctors registered with the UK’s General Medical Council who are permitted to prescribe medicines without meeting the patient face to face. Prescriptions provided will be NHS funded prescriptions. The General Medical Council registration number of all babylon doctors, past or present, can be supplied upon request. All doctors who have signed up to provide prescriptions through the Company’s systems have undertaken to comply with the General Medical Council Guidelines on remote prescribing, essential standards of quality and safety as enforced by the Care Quality Commission and copies of these can be found at http://www.gmc-uk.org/mobile/14326 and http://www.cqc.org.uk.
If a patient requires a prescription for a controlled drugs (as defined by the misuse of drugs act 1971) the patient is required to verify their ID using a valid passport or driving license with babylon before a prescription is issued. If a valid passport or driving license cannot be provided a prescription for a controlled drug cannot be generated.
The App may enable you to request that we send your prescription to a pharmacy near to you, for you to collect during normal opening hours.
If you choose to have your prescription sent to a pharmacy that is near to your location, we will make reasonable attempts to contact that pharmacy and have the prescription sent to the chosen pharmacy within an hour.
We will use reasonable efforts to deliver the prescription to your device or to a nearby pharmacy promptly but we are not connected with and have no control over or responsibility for any individual pharmacy, their policies in relation to acceptance or otherwise of prescriptions, opening hours, cost or availability of medicines prescribed.  There are a number of factors which may impact on which pharmacy is chosen and there can be no guarantee that a pharmacy to which the prescription is delivered (if that option is chosen) will be the nearest pharmacy.
Our partner dispensing chemists are not part of our organisation and, to the extent permitted by law, we disclaim responsibility for their acts and omissions.





J) TESTING SERVICES
How we provide medical testing services

You should discuss any necessary tests with the GP which may be able to be offered through the NHS in the normal way.  
The App can be used to order certain medical tests (Tests). These services are provided by a partner laboratory with which the Company has entered into arrangements for those services.
Any test kits ordered through the App will be charged to you. Where charges are applicable, this will be made clear to you in advance of any such charges being incurred.
The partner laboratory is a separate entity from us and to the extent permitted by law we disclaim any liability for any acts or omissions of the partner laboratory.
By ordering any Tests, you agree to comply with any instructions provided in relation to the Tests including in relation to the booking and administration of Tests, receipt and provision of Test materials and samples (including delivery by post or attendance in person at Test facilities) and payment.
Subject to a range of factors including (without limitation) the nature of the relevant Test, your location and the availability of laboratories, the App may enable you to:
request the despatch, by post, of a Test to be administered (self-collected) by you and returned to the laboratory by post, with the results then analysed, sent to us and delivered to you through the App;
arrange an appointment to attend a Test centre for the Test to be undertaken, the results to be sent to us and delivered to you through the App;
contact a Test centre, to enable you to arrange to undertake a Test independently and have the results sent to us to be delivered through the App.
You understand and acknowledge that prior to Test results being made available to you within the App, you may be requested to undertake and pay for an additional consultation with a Practitioner.
The prices will be displayed within the App and you agree to those at the time of ordering. Certain pathology services – for example, if you elect to contact a Test centre to undertake a Test independently - may incur charges in addition to those listed in the App and you acknowledge and agree that such additional fees as required may be payable.
If, within the App, you choose to order your Test for delivery to you and administration (self-collection) by you, it will be despatched by our partner laboratory. The terms of delivery shall be as follows:
we will use reasonable endeavours to procure the processing and despatch of your Test within 3 business days where the Test is in stock;
the delivery time following despatch should typically not exceed 3 business days but please note that in relation to delivery to remote locations that delivery time could be longer;
prices and delivery fees are displayed within the App at the time of the order;
delivery will be either by express delivery or refrigerated express delivery, depending on the Test;
Tests are personal to the person for whom they are intended and therefore may not be returned and no refunds will be given for Tests ordered once the order is placed;
orders may be subject to a minimum price as displayed in the App;
we or our partner laboratory may refuse to fulfil an order where we consider the order not to be in the best interests of the person for whom it is intended or who has ordered it or may be illegal or contrary to any regulation or guideline;
if no one is available to take delivery of the order when delivery is first attempted, there may be a delay in delivery, and/or the recipient may have to follow the procedures of the relevant despatch company in order to collect the order, including picking it up from a depot.
Processing time for a returned Test will vary depending on the Test but we will use reasonable endeavours to procure that the laboratory analyses the Test and returns results within 14 business days.  Results will be delivered to you through the App and you explicitly consent to that by ordering through the App.
Tests to be administered at a drop in Test centre will be subject to the terms and conditions of that centre and the opening hours of that centre.
If you elect to arrange an appointment to attend a Test centre for the Test to be undertaken, or to contact a Test centre to enable you to arrange to undertake a Test independently, then we shall use reasonable efforts to assist you but cannot guarantee the availability of the services from the Test centre and is not liable for the acts or omissions of the Test centre.
The Company will use reasonable efforts to process any orders for Test Services within 2 business days and the time limits set out above start running from the end of that processing period.
It may not be appropriate for some Tests to be self-administered, in which case they may not be available for delivery and must be conducted by a registered medical practitioner or nurse.
You cannot order Tests anywhere outside the United Kingdom.


K) MONITORING SERVICES
What our Monitoring service does, what you can rely on it to provide, and when you shouldn't use it

The App is able to display data resulting from clinical investigation, other clinical data and other fitness and wellness related data regarding you for monitoring (Monitoring).
Data may be input into the App for Monitoring:
manually by you;
through third party devices or data streams which connect with the App; and
via data received from or inputted via other parts of the App, for example as a result of undertaking a Test, prescription or a consultation.
Monitoring enables the display of data only, is limited to the receipt of data from the above sources, does not provide diagnostic or other advice or recommendations and does not provide a complete or up to date record of your health at any given time.
It is your responsibility to update the data stored for Monitoring and to ensure that it is current and up to date. We do not update or monitor the data in your account nor accept responsibility for ensuring that all activity through the App is logged for Monitoring.
Monitoring may make use of data feeds from third party providers, including third party providers to which you provide access. You acknowledge and agree that available data feeds may vary from time to time, that the we make no guarantee that any particular data feed will be available or available at a particular time, that data feeds may require your authorisation in order to be accessible to you via the App, and that we will have access to and may store data feeds and data to which you authorise access.
Monitoring services are not a medical device nor should they be used for diagnosis or treatment of any condition. It is intended as an information aid only.
Monitoring may display certain information relating to you derived from data stored for you (for example, body mass index) and recognised guidelines. You should note however that any such display or information provided is based on generic data and assumptions and is not designed to be and may not be used for personalised advice. It should therefore be treated as a general guide and is not a substitute for personal medical advice or diagnosis. It will in addition be based on a number of assumptions that may or may not be accurate or applicable to you. No responsibility is taken for any action or omission that you may take based on in connection with or in reliance upon any information shown in Monitoring.
L) OTHER LIMITS ON OUR SERVICE
Other limitations and restrictions on the use of services

We do not guarantee the availability of any particular Practitioner at any particular time. We will do what we can to arrange a consultation with a Practitioner as soon as possible, but do not guarantee to offer consultations within a particular time. Consultations generally are limited to 10 minute durations (with general practitioners and nurses).
If you choose to submit details about your symptoms in the App, the information returned is on the basis of general healthcare information and not as personalised health advice for you. It is important to read the FAQs prior to using the App so that you can assess whether it is suitable to use the services based on your symptoms. Where the information returned recommends that you seek further medical advice, you acknowledge that you are responsible for seeking such advice from your GP or other medical professional.
Practitioners may hold different clinical opinions on the same medical condition or symptoms and provided these opinions are reasonably held, the fact that two or more Practitioners give different opinions in the course of service provision does not necessarily indicate that our services are defective.
We do not tolerate abuse or offensive behaviour towards Practitioners.
Our services are designed to be accessed remotely by any of our customers, and are not designed for non-English speakers, for excessive use (having regard to the typical use pattern for our services in our reasonable opinion), time-wasting (such as unreasonable cancellation of appointments) or inappropriate use.
We may need to ask you for certain personal information in order to provide our services. If you do not provide this information when requested, we may be unable to provide our services.
The App has not been developed to meet your individual requirements, and that it is therefore your responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the App meet your requirements.
The symptom checking feature of the App is certified as a class 1 medical device with the MHRA.
While certain information controlled, generated by, displayed within or stored in the App (including, without limitation, by the ‘Monitoring feature') may be helpful in providing warning of certain medical or health conditions or circumstances, the App is not designed, nor may you use it as, a device to detect, diagnose, treat or monitor any medical or health condition or to establish the existence or absence of any medical or health condition.
We may suspend your access to services or terminate your account with us if your use of services breaches any of these terms.
M) ACCESSING OUR SERVICES
How to access our services, and limitations and other terms concerning access

Our services are accessed remotely using the internet, data networks and devices which can access the internet (Infrastructure) and operate the App and our Website. We make the App and our Website available for access using Infrastructure, but are not responsible for Infrastructure ourselves. If you wish to use the services, you should ensure you have an internet-enabled device and a sufficient internet connection available.
Technical or security threats or issues affecting the Infrastructure may require us to suspend our services in order to ensure they are secure and/or operating optimally. We will minimise these suspensions, but are not responsible to refund charges or compensate you if they occur, unless they exceed 30 days in aggregate in any 12 month period, in which event you may cancel your agreement with us.

N) CHANGES TO THESE TERMS
What happens if we change these terms

We may need to change these terms sometimes: for example, when the rules regulating our services change, in order to ensure that our services are secure and your information is safe, or when we update or modify our services or our Charges.

Q) CONSULTATION RECORDINGS
We record consultations and this explains why

We may record consultations, activity and data inputted in the App for the purposes of providing our services, ensuring the quality of the services we provide and giving you access to recordings of your use of services.

R) LIMITATIONS ON SERVICE PROVISION        
Sometimes, you will not be able to receive services – this section explains why

We may not be able to provide our services if they are affected by events outside our control. We are not responsible to you if this happens, but if it does, we will notify you as soon as we can and take the steps that we reasonably can to minimise the interruption to our services.
If there is the risk of a delay of more than 2 weeks to service performance, you may cancel your agreement with us (and we may do the same).

The agreement for our services is between you and us, and no-one else. Only you can enforce that agreement (although a parent or guardian may enforce their agreement on behalf of a person under 18 whose use of our services is allowed under section G).
